Test your triggers.
Note: In order for your trigger to fail, you may need to change the time to be outside the
range of your current time in class. For example, while testing, you may want valid video
hours in your trigger to be from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.
-- First determine current timezone and time
SELECT SESSIONTIMEZONE,
TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI') CURR_DATE
FROM DUAL;
-- Change your time zone usinge [+|-]HH:MI format such that the current
-- time returns a time between 6pm and 8am
ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE='-07:00';
